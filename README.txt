There are four files provided: the README, dataInput1.txt, dataInput2.txt, and CaterpillarCLI.py.

dataInput0 and dataInput1 contain the text of the examples given in your email.

Place all four files in a directory that can execute the python interpreter.

Invoke CaterpillarCLI.py with the current directory with the directory delimiter as the single argument:

>python dataInput2.txt ./

This will find the .txt files (including this one!) and return the file name plus port information.  It also answers port and IP information.  It will note that README.txt does not contain useful information.

Thank you for your time and attention,

Jim DuWaldt.
